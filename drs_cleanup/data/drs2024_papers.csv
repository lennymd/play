We are very pleased to submit our manuscript entitled “Measuring mental wellbeing – can we measure it, and if so, what should we measure, and how? A qualitative provotyping study"" for consideration for the 2024 DRS conference. The manuscript presents a qualitative analysis of a provotyping study, in which we look into what young adults consider relevant for their mental wellbeing and whether current technology manages to tap into these relevant aspects. 

To our knowledge, the study is the first to approach mental wellbeing from this angle. Many papers study mental wellbeing starting from a theoretical perspective, others use the current state-of-the-art of measurement possibilities as their starting point. As yet, no study has been made of how theory and state-of-the-art fit actual experiences and preferences of young adults. This study hopes to contribute to bridging this gap. 

We would like to undertake that this manuscript is not currently under consideration by any other journal and will not be copyrighted, submitted, or published elsewhere, while acceptance by the DRS2024 conference is under consideration. All authors approved the manuscript and this submission. 

Thank you for receiving our manuscript and considering it for review. We appreciate your time and look forward to receiving your response.

Best regards,

Sander Hermsen, PhD

First of all, thank you for your work around the design sketch. It's important! My paper will focus on the question of what sketching is as scaffold for thinking. In this it's an important component of my ideas around distributed thinking in design. I'm not sure if this content works with what you are thinking for your session. As reference to the type of paper you could look at DTRS proceedings (Design Thinking Research Symposia) - last held at Technion Israel.

Thanks, James.","","","","2023-09-20 23:50:55","2024-03-15 07:43:18","0"

I am honoured to submit my article to you and hope to publish it at the DRS 2024 conference. This article explores how visually impaired people use camera-based applications to identify objects and cope with everyday challenges. We provide some suggestions for designing and promoting the applications for disabled users.

I am looking forward to communicating and learning with design researchers worldwide at the conference, sharing my research results and experiences, and learning about the latest design research dynamics and trends. It will be a significant and valuable academic event.

Thank you for your review and consideration of my article.","","","","2023-10-06 07:04:01","2024-03-12 19:20:43","0"

Pluriversal design has, among many disciplines (from human rights to land- and watermanagement), proven to be a 'hot topic' the past years. Of the 113 academic papers I studied for this literature review, more than 2/3 are published in the past 20 months (29 papers in 2023 (Jan - Sep) and 48 papers in 2022). Only 20 papers, i.e. 18%, are from the year 2020 or older. To me, this shows the relevance of this track and I would love to contribute to the knowledge accumulation of this topic. By presenting preconditions, design principles and tools I hope to facilitate scientists and practitioners in their research or design conduct of the pluriversal design paradigm.","","","","2023-10-06 10:23:16","2024-03-17 18:01:18","0"

- The project extended to the development of digital archive and community exhibition which was hosted in Roxbury on the legacy of teh Black Panther. The curation of the local narratives and local community definition and ownership of it's cultural narratives was a key part of the project. 
- The paper will reflect on the work that Black Panthers of Boston sought to address such as socioeconomic issues that are still ongoing issues in the community today, including access to healthy food, community empowerment initiatives, healthcare, and many others. A community garden has been established on this property in an effort to increase access to healthy food and honor the Panthers' heritage. 
- In this respect, the Roxbury neighborhood will offer a suitable case study for considering both the socioeconomic difficulties of the past and the present, as well as the collaborative process of curating cultural objects in the landscape towards a symbolic feature of ongoing spatial justice and community resilience. Lessons from this method may be instructive for Boston communities that face comparable problems and are looking for ways to take charge of neighborhood projects.
