He has participated in many group exhibitions showing several art works featuring different themes, such as: Architecture of Old Islamic Cairo - Still Life - Lanterns of Ramadan Fawanees -  Circus, and later on he made his first solo exhibition about ""Joy of Roses"" including soft pastel sketches and also oil paintings.

Artist Yehia Dessouki has a distinguished style, remarkable for his use of vivid and rich colorful palettes in most of his art-works.
Being raised among an artistic family was an early dominant influence on his art life. His father is the Batik artist Ali Dessouki and his mother was an art critic and lawyer. More influence came along with his summer study trip to Italy (Società Dante Alighieri), giving him a golden chance to visit art museums in Rome, Milan, Florence and Pisa and most importantly, visiting Venice Biennial of Plastic Arts.
Thanks to his passion for digital graphics, he made some diverse experimental digital art works specially in digital painting showing an innovative art theme which mixes between Marionettes of theater and Arabic calligraphy. One of those digital-paintings was the first digital painting art work ever to be published on the cover of a formal Egyptian newspaper Akhbar Al-Adab, which is a famous weekly Egyptian newspaper read by Egyptian cultural elite.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehia_Dessouki

Because he used a ""heavy, cumbrous"" horse-drawn van to reach remote sites in Yorkshire, his nickname there was Van Evans, and he was recognisable with his wideawake hat, pipe and neckerchief.

Cabinet_painting,Cabinet painting,"A cabinet painting (or ""cabinet picture"") is a small painting, typically no larger than two feet (0.6 meters) in either dimension, but often much smaller. The term is especially used for paintings that show full-length figures or landscapes at a small scale, rather than a head or other object painted nearly life-size. Such paintings are done very precisely, with a great degree of ""finish"". 
From the fifteenth century onward, wealthy collectors of art would keep these paintings in a cabinet, which was a relatively small and private room (often very small even in large houses) to which only those with whom they were on especially intimate terms would be admitted. A cabinet, also known as a closet, study (from the Italian studiolo), office, or by other names, might be used as an office or just a sitting room. Heating the main rooms in large palaces or mansions in the winter was difficult, so small rooms such as cabinets were more comfortable. They offered more privacy from servants or other household members and visitors. Typically, a cabinet would be for the use of a single individual; a large house might have at least two (his and hers) and often more.

Later, cabinet paintings might be housed in a display case, also known as a cabinet, but the term cabinet arose from the name (originally in Italian) of the room, not the piece of furniture. Other small and precious objects, including miniature paintings, ""curiosities"" of all sorts (see cabinet of curiosities), old master prints, books, or small sculptures might also be displayed in the room. 
A rare example of a surviving cabinet with its contents probably little changed since the early eighteenth century is at Ham House in Richmond, London. It is less than ten feet square, and leads off from the Long Gallery which is over a hundred feet long and twenty feet wide, giving a rather startling change in scale and atmosphere. As is often the case, it has a view of the front entrance to the house, so that passersby and daily activities can be observed. Most surviving large houses or palaces, especially from before 1700, have such rooms, but they are often not displayed or accessible to visitors. 
The magnificent Mannerist Studiolo of Francesco I Medici in Florence is larger than most examples and rather atypical in that most of the paintings were commissioned for the room.
There is an equivalent type of small sculpture, usually bronzes. The leading exponent in the late Renaissance was Giambologna, who produced sizeable editions of reduced versions of his large works, and also made many exclusively in small scale. These sculptures were designed to be picked up and handled, even fondled. Small antiquities were also very commonly displayed in such rooms, including rare coinage.   

 
Small paintings have been produced during all periods of Western art, but some periods and artists are especially noticeable for them. Raphael produced many cabinet paintings, and all the paintings of the important German artist Adam Elsheimer (1578–1610) could be so described. The works of these two were much copied. The Dutch artists of the seventeenth century had an enormous output of small paintings. The painters of the Leiden School were especially noted ""Fijnschilders"" or ""fine painters"" producing highly finished small works. Watteau, Fragonard and other French 18th-century artists produced many small works, generally emphasizing spirit and atmosphere rather than a detailed finish. In modern times the term is not as common as it was in the 19th century, but remains in use among art historians. 
A ""cabinet miniature"" is a larger portrait miniature, usually full-length and typically up to about ten inches (25cm) high. These were first painted in England, from the end of the 1580s, initially by Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver. 
In 1991, an exhibition entitled ""Cabinet Painting"" toured London, Hove Museum and Art Gallery and Glynn Vivian Art Gallery and Museum, Swansea. It included more than sixty cabinet paintings by contemporary artists.

Critics such as Donald Kuspit (as well as Eddy himself) have resisted such labels as superficially focused on obvious aspects of his painting while ignoring its specific sociological and conceptual bases, dialectical relationship to abstraction, and metaphysical investigations into perception and being; Kuspit wrote: ""Eddy is a kind of an alchemist … [his] art transmutes the profane into the sacred—transcendentalizes the base things of everyday reality so that they seem like sacred mysteries."" Eddy has worked in cycles, which treat various imagery from different formal and conceptual viewpoints, moving from detailed, formal images of automobile sections and storefront window displays in the 1970s to perceptually challenging mash-ups of still lifes and figurative/landscapes scenes in the 1980s to mysterious multi-panel paintings in his latter career.

Hubert_van_Eyck,Hubert van Eyck,"Hubert van Eyck (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɦybɛrt vɑn ˈɛik]) or Huybrecht van Eyck (c. 1385/90 – 18 September 1426) was an Early Netherlandish painter and older brother of Jan van Eyck, as well as Lambert and Margareta, also painters. The absence of any single work that he can clearly be said to have completed continues to make an assessment of his achievement highly uncertain, although for centuries he had the reputation of being an outstanding founding artist of Early Netherlandish painting.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_van_Eyck
Ib_Eisner,Ib Eisner,"Ib Eisner (19 May 1925 in Copenhagen, Denmark – 7 April 2003 in Frederiksberg, Denmark)  was a Danish artist.
His artistic career started in 1945 with entering the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, where he studied in the classes of the Professors Kræsten Iversen (1886–1955), Olaf Rude (1886–1957) and Axel Jørgensen (1890–1963). 
In the early fifties he discovered characteristic motif cycles, which were to influence all of his work. From then on he mostly devoted himself to painting scenes from his immediate surroundings, which he transferred directly onto canvas on site.
Eisner showed particular interest in the long-established Danish forest park ""Dyrehaven"", which offered the painter a wide repertoire of motifs for years.
He also was interested in motifs of the popular amusement parks ""Tivoli"" and ""Bakken"" as well as in scenes from his personal surroundings in Frederiksberg and views of the island of Bornholm. 
Other pictographic themes which were constant factors in Eisner's paintings are still life and the Danish traditional ""Sankt Hans Fire"".
Ib Eisner worked mostly in picture series to explore the nuances of changes of lighting moods and seasons. French Impressionist theme and composition techniques are noticeable not only in his preferred method of operation, the plein-air painting, which from this point on the artist applied in all weather conditions, but also in the treatment and application of colour. These alternate between the fluent, almost sketchy application of colour with thinned oil paints and a paste-like, relieflike flow, deliberately trying to reveal the artistic facture. Eisner applied pure, mostly unmixed colours next to each other in quick brushstrokes, creating a vibrant structure of bright tones and developing an original picture-intrinsic dynamic. He painted mostly without fixed contour lines or preparatory drawings, since the capturing of elusive lighting effects required swift work. With these painting tools, the artist created a unique atmosphere characteristic to each picture.
Ib Eisner's works were purchased by art associations for the promotion of fine arts as well as banks and companies in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and by private collectors. His international recognition is evident through the sale of his paintings to Germany, Sweden, Japan, Great Britain and the United States.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ib_Eisner
